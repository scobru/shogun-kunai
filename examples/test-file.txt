🥷 Kunai (苦無) Test File

This is a test file for demonstrating ephemeral P2P file transfer.

Kunai uses:
- Yumi for signaling
- Direct streaming without GunDB persistence
- Auto-cleanup after 5 seconds
- Wormhole-style transfer codes

Example usage:
  Terminal 1: node examples/kunai-example.js send examples/test-file.txt
  Terminal 2: node examples/kunai-example.js receive

The file will be transferred quickly and leave no trace in the GunDB graph!

 Yumi (弓) - Bow      → Messaging
 Yari (槍) - Spear    → Encryption  
 Kunai (苦無) - Knife → Ephemeral Transfer

Like a ninja's throwing knife - fast, precise, leaves no trace. 🥷⚡
